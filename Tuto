You can see that the original firmware partitions of ubi and ubi1 are 30MB.

Check which partition the FIP is in, some are in partition 4, some are in partition 5; you need to be optimistic about your own

Back up the FIP and Factory partitions:
use the dd command to save to the tmp folder:

dd if=/dev/mtd4 of=/tmp/mtd4_Factory.bin
dd if=/dev/mtd5 of=/tmp/mtd5_FIP.bin
Download the backup to your computer and save it.

uboot brush
Use winscp software to download mt7986_redmi_ax6000-fip-fixed-parts.bin to router tmp directory

mtd write /tmp/mt7986_redmi_ax6000-fip-fixed-parts.bin FIP
After entering the command and pressing Enter, it looks like this:

root@XiaoQiang:~# mtd write /tmp/mt7986_redmi_ax6000-fip-fixed-parts.bin FIP
Unlocking FIP ...

mtd erase FIP mtd write /tmp/mt7986_redmi_ax6000-fip-fixed-parts.bin FIP mtd verify /tmp/mt7986_redmi_ax6000-fip-fixed-parts.bin FIP

Writing from /tmp/mt7986_redmi_ax6000-fip-fixed-parts.bin to FIP ...

Wait 10 seconds to unplug the power directly; the ipv4 address of the computer's ethernet card is fixed at 192.168.31.X (X is a number between 2 and 254)

In de-energized state; hold the reset hole and plug in the power, observe the ethernet board, and you can let go in about 15 seconds. Currently, the first version of Undead Boot does not have an indicator light

After confirming flashing is complete, unplug the power from the router. Then set the IP address of the computer to a fixed 192.168.31.2, then press and hold the RESET button on the router and turn on the power, wait 15 seconds, then release the RESET (because Uboot does not support the LED yet LED , so the light will not be on), use Chrome Enter 192.168.31.1 in the browser, you will see the webpage and select the large partition firmware to flash on the uboot recovery page.

Return to original firmware
